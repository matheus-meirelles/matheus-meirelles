Matheus Meirelles

Interested in frontend and backend development, using HTML, CSS, JS.
Currently, for my new project I'm using Node, Postgres and Expressjs, but maybe I can starting using some frontend frameworks, such as React and Bootstrap.

My project is to create a site like a social media, but I have no idea where to start from

I'm currently learning fullstack web development and some low level concepts.
